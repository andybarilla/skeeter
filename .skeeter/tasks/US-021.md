## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Add `--on-failure` flag with options: revert, leave, prompt (default: revert)
- [ ] Add `--require-review` flag to mark tasks as "ready-for-review" instead of done
- [ ] Add `--timeout` flag to limit LLM execution time per task
- [ ] Add `--tag` filter to only work on specific tag
- [ ] Improve error messages with task ID and failure context
- [ ] Log work sessions to `.skeeter/logs/` for debugging

## Context

Agents need more control over failure handling and task completion flow.

## Implementation Notes

- Extend work.go with new flag handling
- Use context.WithTimeout for --timeout
- Create logs directory and write session logs
- ready-for-review should be configurable status (or add to defaults)
