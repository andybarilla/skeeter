## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] CLI binary builds to bin/skeeter
- [x] Desktop app builds to bin/skeeter-app
- [x] Platform-specific targets available (app-darwin-amd64, app-darwin-arm64, app-linux-amd64, app-windows-amd64)
- [x] Release target builds all platform binaries
- [x] make clean removes all binaries

## Context

Updated Makefile to organize all binaries in the bin/ directory with descriptive names.

## Implementation Notes

- `make cli` -> bin/skeeter
- `make app` -> bin/skeeter-app
- `make app-darwin-amd64` -> bin/skeeter-app-darwin-amd64
- `make app-darwin-arm64` -> bin/skeeter-app-darwin-arm64
- `make app-linux-amd64` -> bin/skeeter-app-linux-amd64
- `make app-windows-amd64` -> bin/skeeter-app-windows-amd64.exe
- `make release` -> all platform binaries
- `make clean` -> removes bin/ and cmd/skeeter-app/build/bin/
