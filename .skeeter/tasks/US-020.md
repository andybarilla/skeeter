## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `skeeter archive --older-than 30d` only archives old tasks
- [ ] `skeeter list --archived` shows archived tasks
- [ ] `skeeter show US-001 --archived` can view archived task
- [ ] `skeeter unarchive US-001` restores to active tasks
- [ ] Archive preserves all task metadata and history
- [ ] `skeeter init` creates archive directory

## Context

Keeps the active task directory manageable for long-running projects.

## Implementation Notes

- Add `archive/` subdirectory creation to Init()
- Add Archive() and Unarchive() methods to Store interface
- Archive maintains same filename structure for easy unarchive
