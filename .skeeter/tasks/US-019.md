## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `skeeter bulk status done US-001 US-002 US-003` changes multiple tasks
- [x] `skeeter bulk assign claude US-001 US-002` assigns multiple
- [x] `skeeter bulk priority high US-001 US-002` changes priority
- [x] `skeeter bulk --from-file tasks.txt` reads IDs from file
- [x] Confirm prompt when affecting 5+ tasks (skip with --force)
- [ ] Desktop app supports multi-select with shift-click (deferred - requires frontend work)

## Context

Reduces tedium for sprint planning and batch updates.

## Implementation Notes

- Created `cmd/skeeter/bulk.go` with Bulk command
- Subcommands: status, assign, priority
- Supports --from-file to read task IDs from file (one per line, # comments supported)
- Confirmation prompt for 5+ tasks, skip with --force
- Simple bufio.Scanner for confirmation (no external library needed)
