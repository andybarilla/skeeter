## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `skeeter search <query>` searches title and body
- [x] `--title-only` flag limits search to titles
- [x] `--tag <tag>` filters by tag in addition to query
- [x] Search is case-insensitive
- [ ] Desktop app adds search bar above board (deferred - requires frontend work)
- [ ] Desktop search filters visible cards in real-time (deferred - requires frontend work)

## Context

Essential for projects with 50+ tasks. Simple substring match is sufficient for MVP.

## Implementation Notes

- Created `cmd/skeeter/search.go` with Search command
- Client-side filtering using List() - no Store interface changes needed
- Uses strings.ToLower for case-insensitive matching
- Supports --title-only and --tag flags
- Supports -o json/yaml output formats
