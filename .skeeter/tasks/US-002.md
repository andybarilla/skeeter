Add a `skeeter next` command that returns the highest-priority unassigned task
in `ready-for-development` status. This is the primary interface for coding
agents — they run `skeeter next`, get a task, and start working.

If multiple tasks share the same priority, prefer the lowest ID (oldest task).
When no tasks are available, exit with a clear message and non-zero exit code
so agents can detect there's nothing to do.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `skeeter next` prints the full task details (same format as `show`)
- [ ] Filters to `status: ready-for-development` and empty `assignee`
- [ ] Sorts by priority (critical > high > medium > low), then by ID ascending
- [ ] `--assign <name>` flag auto-assigns and moves to `in-progress` in one step
- [ ] Exits with code 1 and message "No tasks available" when queue is empty
- [ ] `--quiet` flag outputs only the task ID (for scripting)

## Context

- `internal/store/store.go` — may need a `Next(assignee string)` method on the Store interface
- `cmd/skeeter/show.go` — reuse the display formatting
- Priority ordering should come from the config's `priorities` list (index = rank)
